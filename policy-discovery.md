# Setup instructions for auto-policy-discovery

## 1. Clone explorer-charts
Explorer-charts is an Accuknox tool to setup the test environment with all relevant accuknox components in a test cluster.
```
git clone git@github.com:accuknox/explorer-charts.git
cd explorer-charts
```

## 2. Setup k8s cluster (optional if you already have one)
```
minikube start --network-plugin=cni --memory=8192 --cpus=8
```
If you plan on using google microservices demo then you needs atleast 8 cpus and 8GB RAM.

## 3. Install components on k8s cluster
```
./install.sh
```
... this will take some time .. will install cilium/autopolicy/feeder-service/mysql/.. etc

## 4. Install your favourite demo app (optional)
Try following if you want to use [Online Boutique App aka Google Microservice Demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo):
```
kubectl apply -f other/google-uservice-demo-kubernetes-manifests-minikube.yaml
```
Note that the original google microservice demo manifest has been modified to work on minikube.
Even if there are no additional apps installed there will be policies discovered in system namespaces.

## 5. Get discovered policies
The policies will be auto-discovered inside knoxautopolicy pod. You may have to wait for policies to be discovered .. we trigger auto-discovery every 1000 flows received (with google microservice demo this would be less than a min)
```
./get_discovered_yamls.sh
```

Typical output:
```
‚ùØ ./get_discovered_yamls.sh
Downloading discovered policies from pod=knoxautopolicy-74f5b5d65b-tv7v7
Got 9 cilium policies for namespace=accuknox-agents in file cilium_policies_accuknox-agents.yaml
Got 5 cilium policies for namespace=kube-system in file cilium_policies_kube-system.yaml
Got 2 cilium policies for namespace=spire in file cilium_policies_spire.yaml
Got 9 knox policies for namespace=accuknox-agents in file knox_policies_accuknox-agents.yaml
Got 5 knox policies for namespace=kube-system in file knox_policies_kube-system.yaml
Got 2 knox policies for namespace=spire in file knox_policies_spire.yaml
```
You can run this command as many times as you like. Every run it will get the latest discovered YAMLs.
At the end you will have YAMLs file with auto-discovered policies.
